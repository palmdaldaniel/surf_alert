It's quite challenging to surf in sweden. It's unpredictable and requires a lot of wind. The best waves are produced in hailing winterstorm and strong onshore winds. Really the opposite to ideal surf condition anywhere else on the planet.

Surf Alert helps you keep track of condtions and a user can add their own locations and specify conditions when their is a posibilty for surf. When theese conditions are met Surf Alert will let you know that it's time to get going ðŸ”¥!
